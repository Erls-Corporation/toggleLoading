# jQuery Loading Plugin

This plugin is designed to place an alpha transparent PNG spinner nicely on top of dynamically loading content. There are currently no spinner plugins that use an alpha transparent PNG, rather they all use horribly animated GIFs. I think that's kind of old school by now. Since support for animated PNGs is still quite far off, this plugin proposes an alternative solution by utilising CSS background position to recreate the desired effect.

## How to use

`$('div').loading();`

## My first plugin

This is my very first repository on GitHub, and my very first jQuery plugin too. I would really appreciate any contribution to my code, so that I can learn, and hopefully become a better coder. At the same time, the world might finally end up with a nice solution for loading ajax content.
